## Code Guidelines

### C# Code Style

- Follow standard C# naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs
- Keep methods focused and single-purpose
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Use Umbraco's `IScopeProvider` for database operations
- Use `IServiceScopeFactory` for background tasks

### JavaScript Code Style

- Use ES6+ features
- Follow LitElement conventions for web components
- Use `UmbElementMixin` for Umbraco integration
- Clean up intervals and event listeners in `disconnectedCallback()`

### Database Migrations

- Always create migrations for schema changes
- Test migrations on both SQLite and SQL Server
- Use Umbraco's migration API (no raw SQL Server-specific syntax)
- Check `TableExists()` before creating tables
